# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life implemented with Python and Pygame

Initial commit by Tom Burrows - September 2017

Run individual files by editing the global variable `FILE` at the top of `game_of_life.py` or run `demo.py` which will go through all the files in `demo_files/`. The first number on the first line of the demo files is how many iterations to run it for, the second number is how many seconds in between each iteration.
